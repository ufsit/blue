# Webandaid
To quote the visionary singer-songwriter Taylor Swift:
> Band-aids don't fix bullet holes

Well, what if they could? This is a band-aid to slap onto the web 
applications that are often riddled with bullet holes in security
competitions. Of course, this isn't a *fix* per se, it simply delays
attackers (hopefully enough so that any issues can be fixed).

This is meant to be "first aid" for a vulnerable server. It is
intended to be set up in minutes, but is by no means a comprehensive
solution.
